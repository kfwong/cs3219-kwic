A bitterness crept into her face
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
A book to beguile the tedious hours
A brave but turbulent aristocracy
A broad complacent admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
A burlesque feint of evading a blow
A callous and conscienceless brute
A calm and premeditated prudence
A calmness settled on his spirit
A campaign of unbridled ferocity
A carefully appraising eye
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
A certain implication of admiring confidence
A charming air of vigor and vitality
A childish belief in his own impeccability
A cold hard frosty penuriousness was his prevalent characteristic
A compassion perfectly angelic
A constant stream of rhythmic memories
A covertly triumphant voice
A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses
A crop of disappointments
A cunning intellect patiently diverting every circumstance to its design
A curious and inexplicable uneasiness
A curious vexation fretted her
A daily avalanche of vituperation
A dandified prettyboylooking sort of figure
A dark and relentless fate
A day monotonous and colorless
A dazzling completeness of beauty
A deep and brooding resentment
A delicious throng of sensations
A deliciously tantalizing sense
A detached segment of life
A dire monotony of bookish idiom
A disheveled and distraught figure
A face singularly acute and intelligent
A faint accent of reproach
A faint sense of compunction moved her
A faint transient wistful smile lightened her brooding face
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare
A fawncolored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
A fever of enthusiasm
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
A figure full of decision and dignity
A firm and balanced manhood
A first faint trace of irritation
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
A flood of pride rose in him
A foreboding of some destined change
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
A frigid touch of the hand
A fugitive intangible charm
A gay exuberance of ambition
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
A glance of extraordinary meaning
A glassy expression of inattention
A glassy stare of deprecating horror
A glittering infectious smile
A gloom overcame him
A golden haze of pensive light
A golden summer of marvelous fertility
A graceful readiness and vigor
A grave man of pretending exterior
A great pang gripped her heart
A great process of searching and shifting
A great sickness of heart smote him
A great soul smitten and scourged
but still invested with the dignity of immortality
A grim and shuddering fascination
A gush of entrancing melody
A gusty breeze blew her hair about unheeded
A halfbreathless murmur of amazement and incredulity
A halfuneasy halflaughing compunction
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
A harvest of barren regrets
A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air
A helpless anger simmered in him
A hint of death in the icy breath of the gale
A hot and virulent skirmish
A hot uprush of hatred and loathing
A kind of ineffable splendor crowns the day
A lapse from the wellordered decencies of civilization
A large rich copious human endowment
A late star lingered remotely burning
A laugh of jovial significance
A light of unwonted pleasure in her eyes
A little jaded by gastronomical exertions
A lukewarm and selfish love
A man of imperious will
A man of matchless modesty and refinement
A manner bright with interest and interrogation
A manner nervously anxious to please
A melancholy monotone beat on ones heart
A mere exhibition of fussy diffuseness
A mere figment of a poets fancy
A mien and aspect singularly majestic
A mild and deprecating air
A mind singularly practical and sagacious
A mouth of inflexible decision
A murmur of complacency
A mystery everlastingly impenetrable
A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight
A new and overmastering impulse
A new doubt assailed her
A new marvel of the sky
A new trouble was dawning on his thickening mental horizon
A nimblewitted opponent
A painful thought was flooding his mind
A pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn
A patience worthy of admiration
A perfect carnival of fun
A perfect crime of clumsiness
A piteous aspect of woe
A portent full of possible danger
A potion to be delicately supped at leisure
A powerful agitation oppressed him
A prevailing sentiment of uneasy discontent
A prey to listless uneasiness
A profound and absorbing interest
A profound and eager hopefulness
A profound and rather irritating egotist by nature
A prop for my faint heart
A propitious sky marbled with pearly white
A protest wavered on her lip
A puissant and brilliant family
A queer uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her
A quick flame leaped in his eyes
A quick shiver ruffled the brooding stillness of the water
A quiver of resistance ran through her
A remarkable fusion of morality and art
A random gleam of light
A rare and dazzling order of beauty
A rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy
A river of shame swept over him
A sad inquiry seemed to dwell in her gaze
A satisfied sense of completeness
A secret sweeter than the sea or sky can whisper
A sensation of golden sweetness and delight
A sense of desolation and disillusionment overwhelmed me
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
A sense of meditative content
A sense of repression was upon her
A sentiment of distrust in its worth had crept into her thoughts
A sheaf of letters
A shimmer of golden sun shaking through the trees
A shiver of apprehension crisped her skin
A shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration
A sigh of large contentment
A sight for the angels to weep over
A skepticism which prompted rebellion
A slight movement of incredulous dissent
A smile full of subtle charm
A smile of exquisite urbanity
A soft insidious plea
A soft intonation of profound sorrow
A soft suspicion of ulterior motives
A solemn glee possessed my mind
A solemn gray expanse that lost itself far away in the gray of the sea
A solemn utterance of destiny
A somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve
A somewhat melancholy indolence
A somewhat sharp and incisive voice
A sonorous voice bade me enter
A soothing and quieting touch was gently laid upon her soul
A sort of eager almost appealing amiability
A sort of stolid despairing acquiescence
A sort of stunned incredulity
A soundless breeze that was little more than a whisper
A spacious sense of the amplitude of lifes possibilities
A staccato cough interrupted the flow of speech
A state of sullen selfabsorption
A steady babble of talk and laughter
A step was at her heels
A stifling sensation of pain and suspense
A stinging wind swept the woods
A strange compound of contradictory elements
A stream of easy talk
A strong convulsion shook the vague indefinite form
A strong susceptibility to the ridiculous
A subtle emphasis of scorn
A sudden and stinging delight
A sudden gleam of insight
A sudden uncontrollable outburst of feeling
A superabundance of boisterous animal spirits
A supercilious scorn and pity
A superrefinement of taste
A swaggering air of braggadocio
A sweet bewilderment of tremulous apprehension
A sweet quiet sacred stately seclusion
A swift knowledge came to her
A swift unformulated fear
A swiftly unrolling panorama of dreams
A tangle of ugly words
A thousand evanescent memories of happy days
A thousand unutterable fears bore irresistible despotism over her thoughts
A time of disillusion followed
A tiny stream meandering amiably
A tone of arduous admiration
A torn and tumultuous sky
A total impression ineffable and indescribable
A tragic futility
A treacherous throb of her voice
A true similitude of what befalls many men and women
A tumult of vehement feeling
A tumultuous rush of sensations
A twinge of embarrassment
A vague and wistful melancholy
A vast sweet silence crept through the trees
A veritable springcleaning of the soul
A very practised and somewhat fastidious critic
A violent and mendacious tongue
A vivid and arresting presentation
A waking dream overshadowed her
A weird world of morbid horrors
A wellbred mixture of boldness and courtesy
A wild vivacity was in her face and manner
A wile of the devils
A wind strayed through the gardens
A withering sensation of ineffable boredom
A wordless farewell
Absolutely vulgarized by too perpetual a parroting
Absorbed in a stream of thoughts and reminiscences
Absorbed in the scent and murmur of the night
Accidents which perpetually deflect our vagrant attention
Across the gulf of years
Administering a little deft though veiled castigation
Affected an ironic incredulity
Affecting a tone of gayety
After a first moment of reluctance
After an eternity of resolutions doubts and indecisions
Aghast at his own helplessness
Agitated and enthralled by daydreams
Agitated with violent and contending emotions
Alien paths and irrelevant junketings
All embrowned and mossed with age
All her gift of serene immobility brought into play
All hope of discreet reticence was ripped to shreds
All the lesser lights paled into insignificance
All the magic of youth and joy of life was there
All the place is peopled with sweet airs
All the sky was motherofpearl and tender
All the unknown of the night and of the universe was pressing upon him
All the world was flooded with a soft golden light
All was a vague jumble of chaotic impressions
All was incomprehensible
All was instinctive and spontaneous
Aloof from the motley throng
Ambition shivered into fragments
Amid distress and humiliation
Amid the direful calamities of the time
An acute note of distress in her voice
An agreeably grave vacuity
An air half quizzical and half deferential
An air of affected civility
An air of being meticulously explicit
An air of inimitable scrutinizing superb impertinence
An air of stern deep and irredeemable gloom hung over and pervaded all
An air of uncanny familiarity
An air which was distinctly critical
An almost pathetic appearance of ephemeral fragility
An almost riotous prodigality of energy
An answering glow of gratitude
An antagonist worth her steel
An artful stroke of policy
An assumption of hostile intent
An assurance of goodnature that forestalled hostility
An atmosphere of extraordinary languor
An atmosphere thick with flattery and toadyism
An attack of peculiar virulence and malevolence
An audacious challenge of ridicule
An avidity that bespoke at once the restlessness
and the genius of her mind
An awe crept over me
An eager and thirsty ear
An easy prey to the powers of folly
An effusive air of welcome
An equal degree of wellbred worldly cynicism
An erect martial majestic and imposing personage
An eternity of silence oppressed him
An expression of mildly humorous surprise
An expression of rare and inexplicable personal energy
An exquisite perception of things beautiful and rare
An iciness a sinking a sickening of the heart
An ignoring eye
An impenetrable screen of foliage
An impersonal and slightly ironic interest
An impervious beckoning motion
An inarticulate echo of his longing
An increased gentleness of aspect
An incursion of the loud the vulgar and meretricious
An inexplicable and uselessly cruel caprice of fate
An inexpressible fervor of serenity
An ingratiating awkward and wistful grace
An inspired ray was in his eyes
An instant she stared unbelievingly
An intense and insatiable hunger for light and truth
An intense travail of mind
An obscure thrill of alarm
An odd little air of penitent selfdepreciation
An open wit and recklessness of bearing
An oppressive sense of strange sweet odor
An optimistic afterdinner mood
An overburdening sense of the inexpressible
An uncomfortable premonition of fear
An unfailing sweetness and unerring perception
An unpleasant and heavy sensation sat at his heart
An unredeemed dreariness of thought
An unsuspected moral obtuseness
An utter depression of soul
And day peers forth with her blank eyes
And what is all this pother about
Animated by noble pride
Anticipation painted the world in rose
Appalled in speechless disgust
Appealing to the urgent temper of youth
Apprehensive solicitude about the future
Ardent words of admiration
Armed all over with subtle antagonisms
Artless and unquestioning devotion
As if smitten by a sudden spasm
As the long train sweeps away into the golden distance
August and imperial names in the kingdom of thought
Awaiting his summons to the eternal silence
Bandied about from mouth to mouth
Barricade the road to truth
Bartering the higher aspirations of life
Beaming with pleasurable anticipation
Before was the open malignant sea
Beguiled the weary soul of man
Beneath the cold glare of the desolate night
Bent on the lofty ends of her destiny
Beset by agreeable hallucinations
Beset with smiling hills
Beside himself in an ecstasy of pleasure
Betokening an impulsive character
Beyond the farthest edge of night
Birds were fluting in the tuliptrees
Biting sentences flew about
Black inky night
Blithe with the bliss of the morning
Blown about by every wind of doctrine
Bookish precision and professional peculiarity
Borne from lip to lip
Borne onward by slowfooted time
Borne with a faculty of willing compromise
Bowed with a certain frigid and deferential surprise
Broke in a stupendous roar upon the shuddering air
Browsing at will on all the uplands of knowledge and thought
Buffeted by all the winds of passion
Buried hopes rose from their sepulchers
Buried in the quicksands of ignorance
But none the less peremptorily
By a curious irony of fate
By a happy turn of thinking
By virtue of his impassioned curiosity
Carried the holiday in his eye
Chafed at the restraints imposed on him
Cheeks furrowed by strong purpose and feeling
Childlike contour of the body
Cleansed of prejudice and selfinterest
Cloaked in prim pretense
Clothed with the witchery of fiction
Clutch at the very heart of the usurping mediocrity
Cold gaze of curiosity
Collapse into a dreary and hysterical depression
Comment of rare and delightful flavor
Conjuring up scenes of incredible beauty and terror
Conscious of unchallenged supremacy
Constant indulgence of wily stratagem and ambitious craft
Contemptuously indifferent to the tyranny of public opinion
Covered with vegetation in wild luxuriance
Crisp sparkle of the sea
Crystallize about a common nucleus
Cultivated with a commensurate zeal
Current play of light gossip
Curtains of opaque rain
Dallying in maudlin regret over the past
Dark with unutterable sorrows
Darkness oozed out from between the trees
Dawn had broken
Day stood distinct in the sky
Days of vague and fantastic melancholy
Days that are brief and shadowed
Deep shame and rankling remorse
Deficient in affectionate or tender impulses
Delicately emerging stars
Delicious throng of sensations
Despite her pretty insolence
Dignity and sweet patience were in her look
Dim opalescence of the moon
Dimly foreshadowed on the horizon
Dimmed by the cold touch of unjust suspicion
Disfigured by passages of solemn and pompous monotony
Disguised itself as chill critical impartiality
Dismal march of death
Distinguished by hereditary rank or social position
Distract and beguile the soul
Distressing in their fatuous ugliness
Diverted into alien channels
Diverting her eyes she pondered
Dogs the footsteps
Doled out in miserly measure
Doubt tortured him
Doubts beset her lonely and daring soul
Down the steep of disenchantment
Dreams and visions were surpassed
Dreams that fade and die in the dim west
Drear twilight of realities
Drift along the stream of fancy
Drowned in the deep reticence of the sea
Drowsiness coiled insidiously about him
Dull black eyes under their precipice of brows
Earth danced under a heat haze
Easily moved to gaiety and pleasure
Either way her fate was cruel
Embrace with ardor the prospect of serene leisure
Endearing sweetness and manner
Endeavoring to smile away his chagrin
Endlessly shifting moods
Endowed with all those faculties
that can make the world a garden of enchantment
Endowed with life and emphasis
Enduring with smiling composure
the near presence of people who are distasteful
Enjoyed with astonishing unscrupulousness
Enticed irresistibly by the freedom of an open horizon
Essay a flight of folly
Evanescent shades of feeling
Events took an unexpected sinister turn
Every curve of her features seemed to express
a fine arrogant acrimony and harsh truculence
Everywhere the fragrance of a bountiful earth
Exasperated by what seemed a wilful pretense of ignorance
Exhibits itself in fastidious crotchets
Expectation darkened into anxiety
Experience and instinct warred within her
Exquisite graciousness of manner
Exquisitely stung by the thought
Familiar and endearing intimacy
Fatally and indissolubly united
Fathomless depths of suffering
Fear held him in a vice
Feeding his scholarly curiosity
Feeling humiliated by the avowal
Felicitousness in the choice and exquisiteness in the collocation of words
Fettered by poverty and toil
Feverish tide of life
Fine precision of intent
Fitful tumults of noble passion
Fleeting touches of something alien and intrusive
Floating in the clouds of reverie
Fluctuations of prosperity and adversity
Flushed with a suffusion that crimsoned her whole countenance
Forebodings possessed her
Foreshadowing summers end
Forever echo in the heart
Forever sings itself in memory
Formless verbosity and a passionate rhetoric
Fragments of most touching melody
Free from rigid or traditional fetters
Freedom and integrity of soul
Freighted with strange vague longings
Frosty thraldom of winter
Fugitive felicities of thought and sensation
Full of dreams and refinements and intense abstractions
Full of majestic tenderness
Gathering all her scattered impulses into a passionate act of courage
Gaze dimly through a maze of traditions
Generosity pushed to prudence
Gleams of sunlight bewildered like ourselves
struggled surprised through the mist and disappeared
Glowing with haste and happiness
Go straight as if by magic to the inner meaning
Goaded on by his sense of strange importance
Graceful length of limb and fall of shoulders
Great shuddering seized on her
Green hills pile themselves upon each others shoulders
Grim and sullen after the flush of the morning
Guilty of girlish sentimentality
Half choked by a rising paroxysm of rage
Halfsuffocated by his triumph
Hardened into convictions and resolves
Haughtiness and arrogance were largely attributed to him
Haunt the recesses of the memory
Haunted with a chill and unearthly foreboding
He accosted me with trepidation
He adroitly shifted his ground
He airily lampooned their most cherished prejudices
He bowed submission
He braced himself to the exquisite burden of life
He condescended to intimate speech with her
He conversed with a colorless fluency
He could detect the hollow ring of fundamental nothingness
He could do absolutely naught
He drank of the spirit of the universe
He drew near to a desperate resolve
He evinced his displeasure by a contemptuous sneer or a grim scowl
He felt an unaccountable loathing
He felt the ironic rebound of her words
He flung diffidence to the winds
He flushed crimson
He found the silence intolerably irksome
He frowned perplexedly
He gave her a baffled stare
He gave himself to a sudden daydream
He gave his ear to this demon of false glory
He grew wanton with success
He had acted with chivalrous delicacy of honor
He had the eye of an eagle in his trade
He had the gift of deep dark silences
He held his breath in admiring silence
He laughed away my protestations
He lent no countenance to the insensate prattle
He listened greedily and gazed intent
He made a loathsome object
He made the politest of monosyllabic replies
He murmured a civil rejoinder
He murmured a vague acceptance
He mused a little while in grave thought
He never wears an argument to tatters
He only smiled with fatuous superiority
He paused stunned and comprehending
He perceived the iron hand within the velvet glove
He raised a silencing hand
He ruled autocratically
He sacrificed the vulgar prizes of life
He sat on thorns
He set his imagination adrift
He shambled away with speed
He sighed deeply from a kind of mental depletion
He smote her quickening sensibilities
He submitted in brooding silence
He suppressed every sign of surprise
He surrendered himself to gloomy thought
He threaded a labyrinth of obscure streets
He threw a tons weight of resolve upon his muscles
He threw out phrases of illhumor
He threw round a measuring eye
He treads the primrose path of dalliance
He used an unguarded adjective
He was a tall dark saturnine youth sparing of speech
He was aware of emotion
He was born to a lively and intelligent patriotism
He was dimly mistrustful of it
He was discreetly silent
He was empty of thought
He was entangled in a paradox
He was giving his youth away by handfuls
He was haunted and begirt by presences
He was measured and urbane
He was most profoundly skeptical
He was nothing if not grandiloquent
He was quaking on the precipice of a bad bilious attack
He was utterly detached from life
He went hot and cold
He would fall into the blackest melancholies
He writhed in the grip of a definite apprehension
He writhed with impotent humiliation
Her blank gaze chilled you
Her bright eyes were triumphant
Her eyes danced with malice
Her eyes dilated with pain and fear
Her eyes were full of wondering interest
Her eyes were limpid and her beauty was softened
by an air of indolence and languor
Her face stiffened anew into a gray obstinacy
Her face was lit up by a glow of inspiration and resolve
Her haughty step waxed timorous and vigilant
Her head throbbed dangerously
Her heart appeared to abdicate its duties
Her heart fluttered with a vague terror
Her heart pounded in her throat
Her heart was full of speechless sorrow
Her hurrying thoughts clamored for utterance
Her imagination recoiled
Her interest flagged
Her life had dwarfed her ambitions
Her limbs ran to marble
Her lips hardened
Her lips parted in a keen expectancy
Her mind was a storehouse of innocuous anecdote
Her mind was beaten to the ground by the catastrophe
Her mood was unaccountably chilled
Her musings took a sudden and arbitrary twist
Her scarlet lip curled cruelly
Her smile was faintly depreciatory
Her smile was linked with a sigh
Her solicitude thrilled him
Her stare dissolved
Her step seemed to pity the grass it prest
Her strength was scattered in fits of agitation
Her stumbling ignorance which sought the road of wisdom
Her thoughts outstripped her erring feet
Her tone was gathering remonstrance
Her tongue on the subject was sharpness itself
Her tongue stumbled and was silent
Her voice had the coaxing inflections of a child
Her voice trailed off vaguely
Her voice was full of temper hardheld
Her voice with a tentative question in it rested in air
Her wariness seemed put to rout
His accents breathed profound relief
His agitation increased
His brow grew knit and gloomy
His brow was in his hand
His conscience leapt to the light
His constraint was excruciating
His curiosity is quenched
His dignity counseled him to be silent
His ears sang with the vibrating intensity of his secret existence
His eyes had a twinkle of reminiscent pleasantry
His eyes literally blazed with savage fire
His eyes shone with the pure fire of a great purpose
His eyes stared unseeingly
His face caught the full strength of the rising wind
His face dismissed its shadow
His face fell abruptly into stern lines
His face lit with a fire of decision
His face showed a pleased bewilderment
His face torn with conflict
His face was gravely authoritative
