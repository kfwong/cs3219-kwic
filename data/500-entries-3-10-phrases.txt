A bitterness crept into her face
A blazing blue sky poured down torrents of light
A book to beguile the tedious hours
A brave but turbulent aristocracy
A broad complacent admiring imbecility breathed from his nose and lips
A burlesque feint of evading a blow
A callous and conscienceless brute
A calm and premeditated prudence
A calmness settled on his spirit
A campaign of unbridled ferocity
A carefully appraising eye
A ceaselessly fleeting sky
A certain implication of admiring confidence
A charming air of vigor and vitality
A childish belief in his own impeccability
A cold hard frosty penuriousness was his prevalent characteristic
A compassion perfectly angelic
A constant stream of rhythmic memories
A covertly triumphant voice
A creature of the most delicate and rapid responses
A crop of disappointments
A cunning intellect patiently diverting every circumstance to its design
A curious and inexplicable uneasiness
A curious vexation fretted her
A daily avalanche of vituperation
A dandified prettyboylooking sort of figure
A dark and relentless fate
A day monotonous and colorless
A dazzling completeness of beauty
A deep and brooding resentment
A delicious throng of sensations
A deliciously tantalizing sense
A detached segment of life
A dire monotony of bookish idiom
A disheveled and distraught figure
A face singularly acute and intelligent
A faint accent of reproach
A faint sense of compunction moved her
A faint transient wistful smile lightened her brooding face
A faint tremor of amusement was on his lips
A faintly quizzical look came into his incisive stare
A fawncolored sea streaked here and there with tints of deepest orange
A fever of enthusiasm
A few tears came to soften her seared vision
A fiery exclamation of wrath and disdain
A figure full of decision and dignity
A firm and balanced manhood
A first faint trace of irritation
A fitful boy full of dreams and hopes
A flame of scarlet crept in a swift diagonal across his cheeks
A fleeting and furtive air of triumph
A flood of pride rose in him
A foreboding of some destined change
A fortuitous series of happy thoughts
A frigid touch of the hand
A fugitive intangible charm
A gay exuberance of ambition
A generation of men lavishly endowed with genius
A gentle sarcasm ruffled her anger
A ghastly whiteness overspread the cheek
A glance of extraordinary meaning
A glassy expression of inattention
A glassy stare of deprecating horror
A glittering infectious smile
A gloom overcame him
A golden haze of pensive light
A golden summer of marvelous fertility
A graceful readiness and vigor
A grave man of pretending exterior
A great pang gripped her heart
A great process of searching and shifting
A great sickness of heart smote him
A great soul smitten and scourged
but still invested with the dignity of immortality
A grim and shuddering fascination
A gush of entrancing melody
A gusty breeze blew her hair about unheeded
A halfbreathless murmur of amazement and incredulity
A halfuneasy halflaughing compunction
A harassing anxiety of sorrow
A harvest of barren regrets
A haunting and horrible sense of insecurity
A heavy oppression seemed to brood upon the air
A helpless anger simmered in him
A hint of death in the icy breath of the gale
A hot and virulent skirmish
A hot uprush of hatred and loathing
A kind of ineffable splendor crowns the day
A lapse from the wellordered decencies of civilization
A large rich copious human endowment
A late star lingered remotely burning
A laugh of jovial significance
A light of unwonted pleasure in her eyes
A little jaded by gastronomical exertions
A lukewarm and selfish love
A man of imperious will
A man of matchless modesty and refinement
A manner bright with interest and interrogation
A manner nervously anxious to please
A melancholy monotone beat on ones heart
A mere exhibition of fussy diffuseness
A mere figment of a poets fancy
A mien and aspect singularly majestic
A mild and deprecating air
A mind singularly practical and sagacious   sagacious  wise
A mouth of inflexible decision
A murmur of complacency
A mystery everlastingly impenetrable
A nameless sadness which is always born of moonlight
A new and overmastering impulse
A new doubt assailed her
A new marvel of the sky
A new trouble was dawning on his thickening mental horizon
A nimblewitted opponent
A painful thought was flooding his mind
A pang of jealousy not unmingled with scorn
A patience worthy of admiration
A perfect carnival of fun
A perfect crime of clumsiness
A piteous aspect of woe
A portent full of possible danger
A potion to be delicately supped at leisure
A powerful agitation oppressed him
A prevailing sentiment of uneasy discontent
A prey to listless uneasiness
A profound and absorbing interest
A profound and eager hopefulness
A profound and rather irritating egotist by nature
A prop for my faint heart
A propitious sky marbled with pearly white
A protest wavered on her lip
A puissant and brilliant family
A queer uncomfortable perplexity began to invade her
A quick flame leaped in his eyes
A quick shiver ruffled the brooding stillness of the water
A quiver of resistance ran through her
A remarkable fusion of morality and art
A random gleam of light
A rare and dazzling order of beauty
A rhythmical torrent of eloquent prophecy
A river of shame swept over him
A sad inquiry seemed to dwell in her gaze
A satisfied sense of completeness
A secret sweeter than the sea or sky can whisper
A sensation of golden sweetness and delight
A sense of desolation and disillusionment overwhelmed me
A sense of infinite peace brooded over the place
A sense of meditative content
A sense of repression was upon her
A sentiment of distrust in its worth had crept into her thoughts
A sheaf of letters
A shimmer of golden sun shaking through the trees
A shiver of apprehension crisped her skin
A shuffling compromise between defiance and prostration
A sigh of large contentment
A sight for the angels to weep over
A skepticism which prompted rebellion
A slight movement of incredulous dissent
A smile full of subtle charm
A smile of exquisite urbanity
A soft insidious plea
A soft intonation of profound sorrow
A soft suspicion of ulterior motives
A solemn glee possessed my mind
A solemn gray expanse that lost itself far away in the gray of the sea
A solemn utterance of destiny
A somber and breathless calm hung over the deepening eve
A somewhat melancholy indolence
A somewhat sharp and incisive voice
A sonorous voice bade me enter
A soothing and quieting touch was gently laid upon her soul
